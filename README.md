# Movie Talk

### Version: 1.2

### Project introduction

> â€‹	Movie-Talk is a web application that focuses on discovery and sharing. It relies on film commentator, hot reviews and social functions to help users to get a brand new experience of the movie.  

Through the app, users can publish a review of a movie that they have watched and had something want to express to the others. The review can be like or unlike by others and maybe someone would reply something to the author. We hope the sharing review can help users to more enjoy the movie.  

Also when someone may feel boring and want to find a movie to watch which could make themselves feel relaxed. Then the top list of movies classified by genres and reading the review from others may help the user to make a decision to watch it or not.

The popular reviewer could be followed by others because of the great review. The followers will be noticed when the star reviewer published a new review.
